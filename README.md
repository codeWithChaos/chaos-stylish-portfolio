# Portfolio Project

This project is a portfolio website that does not belong to me, but I contributed as a backend developer. My main task was to implement the authentication system, which includes creating the login and registration pages.

While it's unusual for portfolio sites to require authentication, I added it to demonstrate my basic Django skills. The site is structured so that users must register before accessing the content. This was done purely for practice and to ensure I understood the fundamental concepts of user authentication in Django.

It was a fun way to flex my backend development skills and further solidify my understanding of Django.
